                <h2>A Simplified Life Story of Yingyang Liang</h2>
                <p>I was born in Singapore and moved to Shanghai, China when I was 7.
                There I studied at the Singapore Shanghai International School
                and at Shanghai American School.
                I graduated at 2017 and enlisted into the Singapore
                Armed Forces to fulfill my national service obligation.
                Upon my graduation, I came to Tufts. Here I am now having
                completed my second year at Tufts and taking summer classes,
                currently doing the homework for one of them right now.
