                <h2>A Simplified Life Story of Yingyang Liang</h2>
                <p>I was born in Singapore but moved to Shanghai, China when I was 7.
                There I studied at the Singapore Shanghai International School
                for a while then transferred to Shanghai American School.
                I graduated at 2017 and soon enlisted into the Singapore
                Armed Forces to serve the mandatory national service requirement.
                During my time in the army I fired some guns and even got to go on
                traning trips to Taiwan and Australia. Upon my discharge, I
                came to Tufts to study Computer Science. Here I am now having
                completed my second year at Tufts and taking summer classes,
                currently doing the homework for one of them right now.
